# Bounce

Bounce is a simple 2D screen saver created using the [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) game framework. In this 'game', you watch a bouncing square that leaves a colorful trail behind it. The square changes color in a rainbow-like pattern, creating a visually appealing effect as it moves around the screen.
